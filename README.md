# Git commands
## Before you paste the code:
- git branch -r
  -  Opens up all branches in the local repo
-  git checkout -b (below)
  - This command creates a new branch so you can work on your own branch separately from the main one
    -  Harshita, I want you to replace the parentheses above with the stuff to the right: MathTools/Code
    -  Vicente, I want you to replace the parentheses above with the stuff to the right: Convert/Code
    -  Abdullah, I want you to replace the parentheses above with the stuff to the right: Flashcards/Code

## After running commands above and pasting emailed code:
- git add .
  - Make sure you add the period, this adds all the files changed to the pull request
- git commit -m "Updated (name of file you worked on)"
  - Replace parenthesis with file you updated
- git push origin (below)
  - This command pushes it to github, but doesn't apply any changes. Once you are done with this, let me know so I can get the rest done on github.
